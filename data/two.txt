Wipe and reinstall is the only secure way to bring the service back up. With a message transfer agent (MTA) like exim it is sensible to have a second fallback MTA for redundancy, which also buys time if you are hacked. Before wiping and reinstalling it is best to clone the disk so you can get the machine running again quickly but still have a copy of all software and files the attacker has installed. USB disks are large and cheap. Don't rely on log files as a skilled attacker will leave no traces in them. You do want to go to the trouble of finding out how the attacker got in to avoid them simply breaking into your new install with the same method of attack.
